    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Bulgogi is a Korean dish made of thin, marinated slices of meat, most commonly beef, grilled on a barbecue or on a stove-top griddle. 
        It is also often stir-fried in a pan in home cooking. 
        Sirloin and rib eye are frequently used cuts of beef for the dish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds boneless rib eye steak</li>
        <li>½ small pear, peeled and coarsely grated</li>
        <li>¼ cup reduced sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon gochujang, Korean red pepper paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wrap steak in plastic wrap, and place in the freezer for 30 minutes. Unwrap and slice across the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine pear, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger and gochujang. 
            In a gallon size Ziploc bag, combine soy sauce mixture and steak; marinate for at least 2 hours to overnight, turning the bag occasionally.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a cast iron grill pan over medium-high heat. 
            Working in batches, add steak to the grill pan in a single layer and cook, flipping once, until charred and cooked through, about 2-3 minutes per side. 
            Repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and steak.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, garnished with green onions and sesame seeds, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
